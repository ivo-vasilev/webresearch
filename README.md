# webresearch
Project dedicated to researching information.

In this project I am using pure Python to create my scripts and the Python package <b>sumy</b>. You can learn more about it here: https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy. I choose the Wikipedia's search engine to directly take me to the article's page and sumy will summarize sentences from the page for us. I have chosen to use an heuristic method (<b><i>LuhnSummarizer</i></b>) to select the sentences.

Finally, my script will <i>read</i> (in addition to display) the results using a computer voice. I wrote this program in Windows and I am using an amazing small application to make my computer talk through a command line interface (CLI). It is called <b>wsay</b>. Like the Mac OS say command, but for Windows. You can find more details and get the application here: https://github.com/p-groarke/wsay.
